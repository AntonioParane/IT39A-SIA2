*Title:* Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

*Summary:*

The article by Goteng, Shohel, and Tarig explores how universities can enhance student 
employability through collaboration with industries. Specifically, it examines a partnership 
between a university and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy. By incorporating industry-based 
practical hands-on labs into the curriculum, the study finds that students become more engaged 
and better prepared for immediate employment after graduation. This approach ensures that students 
acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for careers in cloud computing.

*Goal*  In the new curriculum for cloud computing, the students will be enabled with practical as well as theoretical knowledge that can be aligned to the industry requirements. The emphasis lies in employability skills such as scalability, virtualization, data analytics, and high-performance computing through AWS Academy resources.  

*Role*:
Students are expected to act like cloud computing professionals by solving real-world challenges with the use of cloud technologies. They participate in hands-on labs and assessments, which emulate work tasks they are likely to experience in real-world IT environments, including designing scalable systems and big data analysis.

*Audience*

The target audience is comprised of cloud computing employers, academic institutions, governments, and technology providers such as AWS. Students demonstrate their abilities and preparedness to the industry stakeholders in the face of their expectations.

*Situation*  
Students are engaged in real-world scenarios where cloud computing is an essential tool for solving technological and business problems. They use skills in virtualization, distributed computing, and data analytics to solve tasks that mirror industry needs.  

*Product or Performance*  
Students produce practical outputs such as prototypes, simulations, or analytical reports. Using AWS Academy tools, they demonstrate their ability to implement, troubleshoot, and manage cloud-based systems effectively.

*Introduction* 
With rising tuition costs, higher education institutions face increasing pressure to deliver value through employability-focused curricula. This report reviews the integration of AWS Academy resources into a cloud computing module to enhance students' theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

*Summary of Key Findings*
The new curriculum include AWS Academy Cloud Foundations, along with hands-on labs, videos, and white papers that are nowadays put into industry standards. Such access to the best practices in cloud computing, career pathways, and internship opportunities was achieved through collaboration with AWS experts.

**Critical Analysis
The collaboration with AWS Academy aligns educational outcomes with industry needs by offering hands-on labs and certification opportunities (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner). However, the model's sustainability may be challenged due to reliance on an industry partner, and its findings are limited to one institution and domain.

*Integration and Synthesis*
The theoretic and practical combination definitely adds worthwhile value to the model. Expanding partnerships to other industries and disciplines, such as data analytics and cybersecurity, may further impact this model.

*Conclusion*
This is a benchmark for employability-focused curricula. Combining theory with practical industry experience will help better prepare students for the workforce by higher education institutions. Future efforts should diversify industry collaborations and evaluate long-term outcomes for broader applicability and sustainability.





*Simple Correct Answer:*

The article discusses how partnering with AWS Academy can improve students' job readiness by combining theoretical learning with practical industry experience.
