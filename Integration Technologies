*Title:* Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web Services Academy

*Summary:*

The article by Goteng, Shohel, and Tarig explores how universities can enhance student 
employability through collaboration with industries. Specifically, it examines a partnership 
between a university and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy. By incorporating industry-based 
practical hands-on labs into the curriculum, the study finds that students become more engaged 
and better prepared for immediate employment after graduation. This approach ensures that students 
acquire both theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary for careers in cloud computing.

*Goal*  
The goal of the updated cloud computing curriculum is to give students theoretical and practical knowledge that is in line with industry norms. By using AWS Academy tools to educate skills like scalability, virtualization, data analytics, and high-performance computing, the emphasis is on promoting employability.  


*Role*  
Students use cloud technology to solve real-world problems in the role of future cloud computing experts. They participate in practical laboratories and tests that mimic tasks like big data analysis and scalable system design that are seen in professional IT settings.  

*Audience*  
Employers using cloud computing, educational institutions, governments, and IT companies such as AWS are among the audience members. Students demonstrate to these stakeholders their abilities and preparedness to meet industry demands.  

*Situation*  
Students work in real-world situations where cloud computing is essential to solving commercial and technology problems. They use their knowledge of distributed computing, virtualization, and data analytics to tackle problems that are representative of business demands.  

*Product/ Performance*  
Students produce useful products including analytical reports, simulations, and prototypes. They show that they can successfully deploy, troubleshoot, and administer cloud-based systems using AWS Academy tools.

*Introduction*  
With rising tuition costs, higher education institutions face increasing pressure to deliver value through employability-focused curricula. This report examines the integration of AWS Academy resources into a cloud computing module to enhance studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding and practical skills.

*Summary of Key Findings*  
The redesigned curriculum incorporated AWS Academy Cloud Foundations, featuring hands-on labs, videos, and white papers aligned with industry standards. Students gained exposure to best practices in cloud computing, career pathways, and internship opportunities through collaboration with AWS experts.

*Critical Analysis*  
The collaboration with AWS Academy aligns educational outcomes with industry needs by offering hands-on labs and certification opportunities (e.g., AWS Cloud Practitioner). However, the model's sustainability may be challenged due to reliance on an industry partner, and its findings are limited to one institution and domain.

*Integration and Synthesis*  
Integrating theoretical and practical learning adds significant value, making this model beneficial. Expanding partnerships to other industries and disciplines, such as data analytics and cybersecurity, could further enhance its impact.

*Conclusion*  
This initiative serves as a benchmark for creating employability-focused curricula. By combining theory with practical industry experience, higher education institutions can better prepare students for the workforce. Future efforts should diversify industry collaborations and evaluate long-term outcomes for broader applicability and sustainability.
